In genre it was described as a radio opera or musical. It could only be performed on radio or as a recorded and produced work, and not on stage as a live performance. The Jury admired the excellent performance both by the singers and the musicians, as well as the actors. The work is extremely successful in combining text to music, or vice versa. Also the music is a clever combination of some ready-made material and music by Gisle Kverndokk, written specifically for this work. The recordings, editing and mixing was first class in presenting sound effects, environmental atmosphere as well speech and music. The work stood out for its totally convincing musical conception and realisation.",

    "reasoning": "Images and stories of life in Russia today are ever present on television all over the world. Among this flood of pictures \"I Love You, Natasha\" confronts us with impressions hardly to forget. This chronicle of motherhood is told with sensibility without falling into misery. It tells us of the painful birth of a new society. Like a matrioska, this film gradually reveals the tottering values of the new Russia: public health, a new market economy, the family, criminality and drugs. The dramatic construction of this film (unity of place and time), the \"fil rouge\" of the birth of a baby, the contrast between inside and outside the hospital, the simplicity of the dialogue and the camera movements, the outstanding quality of the sound and editing make this film a unique experience. The Jury was especially impressed by the \"finale\" of the documentary: optimistic, full of humour and special beauty – which almost in a Fellini way gives a sign of hope in world of suffering.",

With great courage, and taking into account the delicacy of the topic, the director reveals the clues of this terrible fraud one alter the other. The point of view is clear: if somebody can lie about the holocaust, then you can also deny its existence. This film touches us at different levels. By pretending to be a survivor of the holocaust, Whilkominsky chooses the most terrible tragedy of the 20th century as a vehicle for his mythomania. This film questions our own ability to be critical and our judgements about manipulation. The documentary is made in a superb dramatic form and uses all the skills of an efficient narration: a remarkable script and a very precise reconstruction of memory with outstanding use of photographic material and fictional sequences.",

The moving story of two Bosnian widows and their children who return to their devastated country from Germany invites reflection on the meetings and daily conversations among the protagonists demanding a strong direct identification. The situation of millions of human beings who are forced to abandon their land and their loved ones is not irreversible. However bitter, a return is possible in conditions of respect and dignity. Irrespective of the topical issue of Bosnian refugees whose appeals to institutions have failed to receive a just response, The Return's concise script and anti-picturesque stand shows us the human face of a general problem. Without the demagogic depiction of horror and the unbearable, the film shows what has been irreversibly lost, but promises a future and keeps our sense of injustice and justice alive.",

The Jury felt the programme brought a different and commendable voice to the fight. It drew attention to the scale of the disaster but did not concentrate on images of death, or statistics. It was clearly produced on a more limitated budget than many of the programmes entered but nonetheless embraced all elements of the problem, in hospitals, orphanages and schools. \"Together we can\" was an illustration that programme intent, and its human touch, can bring home a message of hope. It is the message, rather than the production values, that is important here.",

It was inspirational, carried a message of hope and presented a world problem, that of refugees and displaced persons, in the context of young children. The programme tells the story of Tibetan parents who send their children on a dangerous crossing of the Himalayas to Nepal, to give them a chance of an education in their own culture and to practice their religion. Many die or lose their fingers or limbs through frost bite in the snows. The camera work is restrained and often beautiful, adding to the impact. The images somehow convey the inspiration of hope in diversity, and the serenity of the Tibetans in meeting their fate. The pictures tell the story, with few words of narrative. The image of young children crawling, exhausted through the snows to rescue will haunt the viewer.",

This was a film which, literally, could be watched by millions and which could contribute to a greater understanding. One Bank, Two Worlds is a worthy winner of the Cardine Special Prize. Shortlist reasoning: A Dutch documentary from NOS about the work of the World Bank in Uganda.  DNW, the Dutch programme maker, took a team to Uganda to put to the test the World Bank claim that this is their showcase in Africa. The documentary turned into a Voyage of Discovery for the viewer as the team interviewed the World Bank people on the ground, the Ugandan authorities at regional and national level, and finally the people in the villages meant to be the beneficiaries of the aid programmes.",

    "reasoning": "An ambitious, challenging play, Brick – in the author's own words – speaks of Croations living off \"air and fog\" in the early nineteen nineties, against a background of social and political upheaval. The characters in Filip Sovagovic's family saga are neither admirable nor loveable – but the jury praised the unremitting honesty of the portrayals, terrific ensemble acting (some of the best we heard), bravura direction and a script tailor-made for radio. A play very much of its times, Brick is a roller-coaster ride through a troubled period in European history, bringing us face to face with the collapse of social and moral values, and the effect this has on families and individuals.",

    "reasoning": "A radio monologue has to have something special to be singled out by a Prix Italia jury. What is exceptional about this NOS entry is the wonderfully rich sound tapestry that envelops this black comic story of a Zeeland girl's search for personal fulfilment. The jury praised actress Ricky Koole's dry, unemotional recounting of the title character's increasingly surreal history – juxtaposed by the beautifully realised soundscapes created by composer Jereon Kuitenbrouwer. These both enhance and provide an ironic counterpoint to the horrors of the journey travelled by our heroine – a journey both real and metaphorical.",

Though treading well-chartered dramatic waters, Albatrosses over Flemingsberg is a most satisfying listen, keeping an audience intrigued and concemed in turn. It charts the complexities of its central characters' emotional lives with real flair, refusing to make simplistic moral judgements. This is a production directed with poise and assurance – with a satisfyingly ambivalent ending and consistently fine performances throughout.",

It draws you in into its supernatural, dramm-like world – erotically seductive and horrific in turn – and sustains the dramatic tension throughout the play.

The first half of the production contains some of the best acting and most imaginative directing we heard throughout our week's listening in both drama categories. The cast brings a sense of fun and high spirits to proceedings, and the production team should be congratulated on bringing a relatively unknown Roman classic to the Croatian airwaves, and giving it a strong contemporary resonance.",

With cleverly cut sequences and a gripping tempo it infects the audience with alarming emotions of hate, fear, anger and ramifications of chilling political manipulation. Yet with equally brilliant strokes it goes beyond the pain and anger to illuminate a light of hope and the power of humanity in the tearless words of a grief-stricken mother, the untold testimony of a rueful soldier and the ultimate decision of an inconsolable and angry brother, who is also a young father. For its captivating treatment of this poignant subject, the Signis Jury presents its award to Sunday, Channel Four Television, UK.",

Delicate and highly meaningful expressions of religious respect for life and family closeness combine with scientific facts to create in the viewer a lasting impression of the preciousness of life.

It is a work remarkable for its intimacy with the listener, and the communication of thoughts and questions. Brazil entertains us, teases us, and makes those of us who profess tolerance and liberality question how far we might be prepared to take it.

Behind the format there is a serious intention on behalf of both the programme makers and the ENO to educate a new public for opera. Shortlist reasoning: This entry is part of a series in which members of the public with good but untrained voices join a competition to see, after some coaching by the staff of the English national Opera, who will 'win' the chance to become an opera singer. In spite of this being in many ways an artificial exercise, the jury acknowleged the programme's achievement in demonstrating the rigours, diciplines and skills rquired to be a professional singer. The format means that the viewer engages with the contestants in their attempts to master the art, and in following their human stories are drawn into the working life of a great opera house. We felt that this genuinely brought opera to new audiences in a way that was funny and touching, as well as serious, and this was proof that 'reality television' can be made with high ambitions.",

Shortlist reasoning: A moving confrontation between survivors and torturers of Pol Pot's bloody regime in Cambodia. Khmer Rouge is a masterful document and testament of our times. Its depiction of cruelty inflicted and cruelty survived is an important historical record which deserves a life beyond the screen. This film will stand as a timeless reminder of the lessons we have yet to learn.

    "reasoning": "The Jury considered that Time Changes / Il Tempo Cambia deserves special mention in that it offered a series of sound miniatures which were composed using a variety of contemporary musical approaches – it offered a compendium of compositional tools which were all compressed into short, fragmentary movements which functioned like postcards or even, cartoons. The work featured textural and rhythmic variety and was humorous and whimsical. The Jury felt that it is a work of contemporary music which is most accessible to listeners. It's structure offers the possibility for random selection of movements and because of this, it is a work which would transfer easily to a multimedia platform. In this way, the listener could also access the images from the I Ching which stimulated the composition of the work.",

The novel approach using a dramatic realisation of the author's script, which was in fact presented by the author in a most convincing way, gave the program a freshness and vitality that was not evident in any of the other entries. The speaker is a listener and his obsession was authentically portrayed throughout the program. It was also well constructed and technically very polished.

With both merciless lucidity and extreme delicacy The Confession explores the dark sides of desire andpower, destroying children's innocence and any further relationships.The jury praises highly the tense and inventive dramaturgical structure, as well as the excellent acting.The Confession is radio drama with its two feet in today's society.",

The use of multicamera in close-ups on musicians and instruments give a close insight of music. The English violinist Andrew Manze has the talent to grab the audience attention and the television coverage has the same effect on television viewers.

It tackles such strong elements like child-slavery, mother and son relationship, American dream of career and many more. The film uses a light, almost humorous way, of revealing the reality which portraits a very sad story.

Ten years after the catastrophe, the documentary follows Blandine, a young woman deprived of her close family and her roots, all along the voyage back to the places and the manifestations of horror. The dense, profound and tender narration confronts the sorrow of the victims, using pauses and silences as well as words and images. But Blandine is determined not to be contaminated by hatred and the desire for revenge: she shows that African wisdom we hope may one day spread the seed of tolerance throughout that threatenedcontinent. The prize is presented to Ms. Emmanuelle De Riedmatten.",

The reality show has a negative impact, mainly among the young people: it induces the public to believe that it's possible to become famous and rich easily and in a short period of time. It's a sort of \"tv doping\". The documentary underlines also how the very few lucky people who succeed through tv, very often are not able to deal with such a success and live the everyday life when they get out of the show. This film can also help the public to have a critical point of view towards the media and particularly television. It offers many possibilities for reflections.",

    "reasoning": "The Cost of Living is a brilliant combination of characterisation, storytelling, physical theatre and dance. The film, set in a seaside resort, shows a group of transient performers marginalised by society, struggling with their daily life. Despite a small cast, a local setting, and a modest duration, the film nevertheless manages to movingly explore wider human issues. Its main theme is relationships: that between performers and their audience, between lovers and between friends. The sensitivity with which it is shot, and the high quality of the direction and choreography, make it a formidably powerful piece of television. Shortlist reasoning: A deft combination of brilliant characterisation storytelling and dance. The film played at several levels using a seaside scenario to represent a strange circus like world within which themes such as performance and voyeurism were explored alongside portrayals of characters struggling with their mundane lives, love affairs and relationships. This was underpinned by a clever formal structure and moments of moving sometimes surprising choreography.",

The theme of parents who reject their children is also strong. The clatter, rattles and whistles of steam engines create a soundscape which is very effective, as is the use of poetry, which is spoken in a natural way, so that it sounds touching rather than artificial. This programme takes the listener on a journey and succeeds in depicting many lives in a short  time. The presenter proves a brilliant host – sensitive and curious. The choice of the characters (who have chosen to answer the phone) is very strong, and they become reporters, offering a powerful and genuine sense of life on the street.",

It conveys a real feeling of passion for music against a backdrop of everyday life. Visually this film is very rough and ready but it is this gritty approach that keeps the viewer wanting more. This portrayal of an everyday jobbing musician is simply brilliant. The producers have clearly demostrated that they understand the universal value of music which can both enthuse and irritate an audience.

We felt this dealt with hugely important questions of racism and belonging but transcended its specific subject matter to tell a universal human tale of identity, self esteem and how we judge ourselves and others. The traditional  linear narrative that formed the spine of it span off with dramatic shifts of tone and direction, including some glorious moments of humour and lightness, that confounded our expectations. Anger, love and hate – the drama switches deftly between these strong and primal emotions to illustrate one mans descent into and out of madness, facing his demons along the way. At its heart is a tour de force performance from David Oyelowo who pulls us through the story, metaphorically but also literally as he frequently talks directly to camera. Though it's a disturbing tale we loved the uplifting positive ending that reflects a message of empowerment not despair. It's youthful and dynamic in style and treatment with great music, and stylish direction. We feel this must have been a challenge to stage and in the wrong hands the script could have been poorly realised. Ultimately we found it a profoundly moving story, with layers of complexity and humanity that gave us much to talk about and think about.",

After viewing it our jury had a heated discussion that illustrated the ambiguity, delicacy and skill with which these fundamental questions were handled. Our own responses altered through our viewing of the film as it challenged our preconceptions about forgiveness, guilt,trust,justice.We loved that it started with a social issue, then became about the dynamic of a relationship. Finally it developed into the deeply personal and spiritual journey of Lord Longford, asking what it means to be a human being searching for the right moral path through life.  Our engagement with the flawed and eccentric character of Longford made us ask questions about our own position as we followed him on his disturbing journey with Myra Hindley where we too were seduced and wrong footed by her at various moments. We were also able to witness the feeding frenzy of an aggressive media while retaining our own objectivity. Longford is also a piece with the highest production values, pitch perfect in areas of costume, make up, design, lighting and with particular mention for the brilliant use of sound. All these elements came together with masterful direction, and extraordinary performances from Jim Broadbent, Lindsay Duncan and Samantha Morton. Andy Serkis deserves a special mention for embodying a visceral, palpable sense of evil as Ian Brady. It reminded us that at its best, television can be a strongly political medium achieving artistic highs while remaining accessible to a large audience.",

Well directed, beautifully lit, framed and edited; a truly cinematic piece with the aesthetic qualities of a fine movie. The murders that impel the story forward are depicted with flair and subtlety and the characters are complex and challenging.

This drama illustrates the heady world of high finance and the banking system, and how decisions taken in boardrooms and offices are made at great personal cost. It's a fascinating dramatisation of value; in financial and human terms. These are difficult and potentially arid principles: finance, capitalism, greed and need, portrayed in a dynamic and engaging way. The actors manage to embody real power and strength, as we are taken inside the belly of the beast where we meet the human face of the corporations that keep the world economy ticking over. This opening episode manages to plant intriguing questions that compel you to keep watching and hook you in to the series with the promise of reveals, twists and turns still to be plundered from backstory and events to come. A fabulous score makes full use of different influences, while great direction and energetic editing uses references from Japanese cinema to give this drama an edgy and gripping feel.",

A multi layered story using the aesthetics of documentary, theatre and cinema and intertwining them in a skilful and innovative narrative structure, where the play within the episode resonates with the themes of the main story. The episode faces a challenging issue head on without compromise, the conflict between motherhood and career, the sacrifices occasioned by a devotion to art, and the long term consequences of our choices on our lives. It's a very natural, authentic piece of drama and a great example of a cinema auteur bringing a high level of craftsmanship to a television drama.",

    "reasoning": "What appears to be a light hearted comedy about the good old days initially entices you into a colourful, nostalgia soaked version of 1970s Spain, like being invited to view a family album, giving a vivid sense of a whole community. True to life, rich in characterisation, witty and charming, a mainstream audience can be enticed in so by the time the tone changes we are absolutely engaged by the fortunes of this multi generational family. The narrative uses the journey from Franco's Spain over the border to Perpignan to see some forbidden movies, as a metaphor for the nature of freedom and repression. Suddenly and surprisingly the episode transforms as the real cost of living under an oppressive dictatorship kicks in due to an unfortunate association between the daughter of the family and an ETA bomber. This piece reminds us of the transitory nature of security at a politically volatile time. Highly coloured, broadly comic and using super 8 footage to open up a window into this not so distant time, with simple production values but an irresistible cast (with special mention for the wonderful performances of the children) it entertains and educates without ever being didactic or heavy handed.",

It follows an Italian health education team who use the opportunity of the World Cup televised worldwide to spread AIDS awareness amongst the population of the country. They erect a big television screen and people come from all over surrounding villages to see live television – many of them for the first time. The film takes us on a journey through the joy and tragedy of Mozambique ravaged by poverty, AIDS and mines left over from the past war.

This work contains all the elements that a good radio programme should have: an engaging presenter, a creative script, an innovative music score. In addition, it also contains the most important element of all: surprise. The audience is constantly captivated by the twists of the plot, eager to discover what the 'hidden' music actually is. Consequently, the listeners' attention never wavers. It appears to be the most brilliantly built programme: its work on sounds is superb, and the story is amusing and well acted. Excellent intergration of music with all the other radio elements: so smooth that often it is hard to tell where one ends and the other starts.",

This program impressed the jury greatly with its close-up, real-life scenes. It is not just another report from the margins of society. The listener becomes part of this story, drawn by the almost invisible hand of the program maker into the trauma and crises of the characters' difficult lives. The rough recordings which elaborate and symbolise the dramaturgy of these troubled lives drew the jury into a closer understanding of poverty and life on the edge. Shortlist reasoning: The program is extremely well structured, and at its heart is a story about two people who are struggling to have a normal life. The jury was particularly impressed by the close up, real life scenes. It develops in an unpredictable and surprising way. The program maker gets successfully involved in the lives of these two people, who represent some of the most vulnerable in society.",

    "reasoning": "This documentary explores the contrast between the classical, formal world of the Russian Bolshoi ballet and the modern, abstract methodology of a young British choreographer. The shooting style reflects the subject matter well by contrasting the restraint and order of Russian ballet with the irreverent, fly on the wall narrative approach. This is a fresh, light approach to the subject matter, and a more modern style of documentary making. The programme achieves a close portrait of the artist and observes his choreographic process, but maintains a pleasingly irreverent sense of humour throughout. The programme offers a unique and intimate look at the creative process as the filmmakers are themselves part of the choreographic process.",

The image of Father Cleary' public life as an unmarried and devoted folksy priest true to the Catholic celibacy rules, abruptly changes after his death. His affair with his housekeeper and the fact they had a son, rocks the nation when the news brakes. The director uses herself in a clever manner, in her journey to uncover the secrets of Father Cleary's covered up family life. Relying on an early observational documentary she did as a student, she captures the spirit of Cleary' secret family life and suprisingly returns to the story 15 years later to find new answers. The result is a very well composed documentary, gradually revealing the Father's shocking double life with his son's destiny as a major component. Beautifully photographed and edited, the story put the larger quesitons of religious life and morality in the Catholic Church, as well as our responsibilities as parents, in perspective.",

This documentary also covers new ground in pursuing the sucessses of the Jamaican sprinters, taking us to Kingston where we learn under what conditions the National sprint team is being coached. Not all glory and success, however, the audience get access to the secrets of Powells own personal mental struggle and how it has impeded him from winning vital races. The film is exciting and entertaining even for audiences not mormally fond of sports or science programs.",

An old issue, but a fresh treatment, and a provocative message about how far even young girls are willing togo to come as close as possible to the ruling image of the perfect body. The film is partly chocking, revealing in great detail that even young teenage girls are willing to use laser on their sex organs and labia lips.

After to periods in the President's chair and now continuing as Prime Minister, Putin has turned Russia into an authoritarian state, beset on restoring Russia as a major player in the world. This film, in production for more than three years and released just before the recent Presidential election, provides an extremely ambitions and amazing account of Putin, his beliefs and his powerbase. A rare display of in depth research, with a large number of sources and widespread footage material, the viewer is elegantly introduced to Putin's childhood, background from KGB, political awakening in St. Petersburg, and onwards to Kremlin. The filmmakers captivate the audience with their critical tretease of Putin's ruling system, and showcase how his political operations de facto has quelled opposition. They have also managed to get strong critics of Putin to voice their concerns, despite the risk of severe repercussions. One of Putins major feats is his control of the major state economic enterprises, not least in the Energy sector. The film raises vital questions about how Western leaders seem to be playing up to Putin, documenting Russia's intertwined role as the European continent's most important energy supplier. A very convincing and timely treatment encompassing many new aspects of Putin's ruling system, wrapped in a compelling presentation.",

Behind the release was a major combined effort by officials and politicians from several countries, and the French president and his wife received credit for the release. But through painstaking research and key interviews, the film convincingly shows that for many years, the imprisoned health workers – despite it could be proved that they were innocent became pawns in an international political chess play. The major players did nothing to find a solution, leading to a nightmare for the imprisoned. Putting together this puzzle of complicated international relations, the filmmakers impress with their clear storytelling, factual presentation and wide source material, hunting down the truth. In the process, they reveal that the real story behind the release differs greatly from the official one.",

Through the film team's extraordinary access to all parties involved, among these devestated parents, a former policeman turned private detective and the brokers themselves, the audience gets a uniqe insight into the horrific results of the authorities' strict children control laws. The oppenness and personal accounts of all the participants are striking, and add to the authenticity of the storyline, including a recapture of a missing child. We meet parents who feel they are forced to sell their children and do so due to financial reasons, and parents looking for their kidnapped children. In both cases, boys are more worth and sought after, the price of a baby girl may be as little as 200 pounds. The film illuminates this tragic state of affairs, evoking strong emotions.",

The Jury selected it for its high technical quality and intensity of insights into the lives and psychology of would be suicide bombers and their accomplices. Still, some of the Jury members were concerned about the circumstances under which the film was made. For instance, did the extraordinary access granted to the reporter come at a price to editorial integrity? Can fundamentalism be understood without also considering the social and political context that foster it?",

To capture the viewer's imagination, any new documentary on the subject would have to take an unique and fresh approach. Blood, Sweat and T-Shirts did exactly that, through the use of six spoiled, British shopaholics, all young. Like embedded troops, they were inserted into the Indian clothing factories and the homes of the men and women who worked there. The experience changed their lives and drove home the point that cheap clothing comes at a cost. The Jury agreed that the use of humour, a compelling narrative and slick editing made this film especially accessible to young people.",

Its subject is the new Green Revolution in one of the poorest regions of India, where 5,000 women are taking control of food production for the sake of their survival, health, financial independence and biodiversity. Their traditional farming methods, ranging from broad seed variety to droughtresistant crops, have transformed their lives for the better. The Jury praised the film for its relevance. The sustainability of food production in an increasingly hungry planet is the central issue of our times.",

The access gained to ordinary Afghan people who find themselves in extraordinary situations, is impressive, and the stories captured are important ones. But Marking's light touch and unpatronising tone makes for a film that entertains as much as it informs.

The Queen and I is a surprisingly honest, very original film, with many twists and turns, as the filmmaker searches relentlessly for the truth. She gets caught up in her emotions and finds her loyalties and fundamental beliefs challenged, and the viewer is invited along on the ride.

The film proposes an alternative, one that seems forgotten in a world erupting in conflicts – talking. Alastair Crooke, the subject of the profile, is not a miracle worker. He believes that listening, talking and understanding are the most powerful tools in conflict prevention. The West labels Hamas a terrorist organization. Hamas considers itself a charitable movement devoted to improving the livelihoods of Palestinians. Crooke uses dialogue to get each side to understand the other. In another era, this was known as diplomacy. The film was not slickly produced. It was gritty and moved quickly through the real, and often dangerous, world of Crooke and his associates. Because he is a superb negotiator with impeccable connections, Crooke, who has spent his career negotiating with the IRA and other \"terrorists,\" was able to convince senior Hamas officials to appear on camera. One was Number 5 on the Americans' most-wanted terrorist list. The jury concluded that the programmes's strength was not its production qualities, but its powerful message: Simple, direct communications can help to resolve conflicts before they turn violent.",

Many documentaries on this topic are like blunt instruments; they hammer the viewer over the head with doomsday messages. Not this one. Recipe treats climate change as everyday challenge, one that can be dealt with at the family level, though not easily. How do you brush your teeth if you cannot buy a plastic toothbrush? How do you visit friends in the middle of winter without a car? Overcoming these obstacles provides the material for a humorous and entertaining family narrative. The jury especially liked the tension between the wife, who is caught in a moral struggle between keeping her family intact without the use of plastics and oil, and her husband's desires to prove that a low-carbon lifestyle is both achievable and necessary. Recipes is accessible and clever, though could have lost 20 minutes. It was too long, in our opinion. It also presented an uncomfortable question that was left unanswered: What if you cannot afford to reduce your carbon footprint? Cheap food comes in plastic wrappers too.",

Perfectly investigated and skillfully directed this long feature documentary about the global rice market and its impact on the third world, is an example how current affairs programs could be interesting and socially engaging at the same time.",

The story turns around three different periods in Annie's life with continuous flash-backs and flash-forwards into her childhood, her life as a married woman and her mourning the loss of her husband. What struck us was the expressive use of colour to highlight the different timelines in the story, which has been hardly seen in other productions.

    "reasoning": "The Woman with Five Elephants is a long, nuanced film with an unlikely subject – an octogenarian, Svetlana Geier, who has spent many years translating Russian literature (especially the novels of Dostoyevsky) into German. At its heart is an indomitable, charismatic, and utterly beguiling central character, lovingly shot by a crew who had clearly won her trust. What impressed the jury was that out of this, the film-makers have forged a meditation on memory, language, the art of translation, but most of all, on the trials posed by the twentieth century's darkest chapter, and on what it takes to survive. What does it mean to have grown up in pre-war Ukraine, your own father a victim of a Stalinist purge, only to find your country overrun by the invading Wehrmacht, first as liberators and later, as mass murderers? For Svetlana's mother the answer was clear – her daughter must learn German. Svetlana's prowess in languages not only saved their lives, it offered her a terrifying vantage point on the atrocities committed all round her. And not just once, but again in 1943, her skill as a translator allowed her to dodge certain death – this time from the encroaching Red Army who would certainly have shot her. Instead, she was allowed to flee with the retreating Germans, and, even more extraordinarily, once back in Germany, to be given a passport, and a teaching post at Freiburg University. Not many ethnic Ukrainians could boast this in 1944. It would be the beginning of a life long career teaching students the treacherous art of translating Russian literature into German. Who better to wrestle with the imponderable difficulties of rendering one language (and its culture) into another, than one who saw at first hand, each at their most savage?",

What started as a profile of a Norwegian activist taking part in a flotilla of ships sailing, in defiance of the Israeli Navy, to deliver supplies to Palestinians living on the Gaza strip, takes an explosive turn. Suddenly, the Norwegian team following him, realised their subject had been caught in the middle of a commando raid on a Turkish ship trying to break the blockade. 9 Turkish activists would end up killed, many others wounded, including a number of Israeli soldiers. We all saw footage of the incident on the news, along with wildly conflicting accounts of what had really happened. This film allowed us to get well behind the headlines, and see, in real time, what actually took place, in all its confusion and panic. Along the way, the film offered a series of portraits of protagonists on both sides of the conflict – a range of activists from around the world, but also, members of the IDF, given the job of enforcing their blockade with the eyes of the world trained on them. Though rough around the edges, the jury felt this was a film that provided a powerful and visceral insight into a story full of controversy and polarised passions. In this regard, it was felt to be a compelling example of what current affairs is charged to do – not only to explain stories after they have happened, but take us right into them, as they happen.",

The drama aims at rebuilding the life and background of these young women and to give the names talked about so much in the news a face and dignity. Even if we only could watch one episode out of three, we think that the production is of exceptional high quality both as far as technical standards as well as the acting is concerned. With all what we have said, we tend to assume that a female audience would be more attracted by the topic.",

As it is an adaptation from a theatre play the protagonist uses the scene as a stage. She plays four different characters.

The story is told in a touching way: the prostitute is shown as a human and kind person who kind of becomes a symbol of the fight against the stereotypes and the prejudices against this type of women. The production is a strong portrait of the reality seen through the eyes of Elena. This allows us to go beyond mere facts and understand the personal reasons hidden behind common places many of us may share.",

What surprised us was the fact that more attention was given to the production values as compared to the script itself. We were impressed about the ending which has shown us how cruel and unfair life can be and how karma can be totally useless. The ending comes somewhat as a surprise: a pedophile, guilty of double murder, goes unpunished. He will never be judged and will always live in undeserved freedom. This leaves a bitter taste but is a much better way out than using a happy ending.",

The bottom line could be \"reality is never easy\": the director has done a great job in highlighting the complexity which lies behind every choice, from the easiest to the most difficult one. During the entire episode, there is a constant struggle of power systems. Every single character shown is confronted with dualistic views such as brain against heart, war against peace, right against wrong, single against institutions thus paving the way for ethical debates about war and the media world. The programme makes a special point in that women are preys and predators at the same time and have to split themselves between their public and their private life. Borgen is very good at looking into reality. The show will for sure arouse discussions, a goal which every good TV programme should try to achieve.",

We totally agree with this description. This is one of the most innovative comedy dramas dealing with disability in a wonderfully comic way rarely seen on television. It is seen through the eyes of Sonja, who has to cope with the problem of having to take care of her disabled husband. The drama's aim is to create awareness that those who are caught in the nurser's treadmill from time to time need to escape to a virtual life. The actors and the situations they have to cope with are eccentric and at the same time very funny.",

The producers went to the provincial Japanese town where the impact of an earthquake, measuring 9 degrees on the Richter scale, created a tsunami towering 40 metres high, leaving l9,000 dead and wreacked havoc on a nuclear power station, exploding atomic reactors. These three images, according to the producers, are engraved on Japan's collective memory, a country which experienced the atomic bombs in l945. One of the many intriguing facts which emerged in the programme was the cultural attitude to nuclear energy, in the authorities' positive view of nuclear expansion to the point where criticism was stifled, to a situation where the future of nuclear generation seems destined to fade, the catastrophe effectively a turning point in history. In it, there are lessons for us all and, given the high quality of the production, its considered and thoughtful approach, we believe ARD are to congratulated and invited to accept a coveted prize.",

Shot over many years, the director portrays his protagonists with loyalty and sympathy. It's a tough film about the loss of love as they give in to their weaknesses. And a rare insight into homeless existences most people would rather not know about.",

The structure of the work mirrors both the community and the individual human being through big \"tutti\" sounds and a poetic central movement played on a single carillon.

It's a successful take on a big challenge. The point of view makes Wagner's Ring accessible to both musically informed and non-informed listeners. The conversational, fluid shape with live speech mixed with a rich variety of music is technically well done. The result is an excellent radiophonic work. The speech and music parts are well balanced. At the same time it recreates the fluid musical shape of the Ring itself. The variety of topics and the shape of the program makes it a highly innovative proposition about one of the world's greatest musical masterpieces.",

Shortlist reasoning: Catherine Milliken and Dietmar Wiesner's \"Bunyah\" is a contemporary radio opera with composed, improvised and recorded sonic elements. It takes the original texts of the poet Les Murray and uses them as a portal for the listener to enter into a complex psychological landscape. The composers treated these original texts with enormous respect and in doing so both preserved and amplified the difficult subject matter they contained. The execution of the piece by the actors, musicians, recording artists and editors was outstanding.",

Shortlist reasoning: Oleg Troyanovsky's \"Encrypted in Music\" is a flight of fancy that explores the conceit that music is encrypted with secret messages from the 16th century right up to our own contemporary music. The presenter's intellectual curiosity engages the listeners and allows them to follow him from clue to clue through this arcane subject matter.  It gives an insight into the composer's minds and the need for constraints to give shape to imagination. The programme yields up fertile ground and adds layers of depth to music for all radio listeners.",

A melange of documentary, memoir, and drama, this work defies category. It is based on personal experience, but Prest warns us at the beginning that some of what we hear may not be true. The program dances on the boundary between the real and the imagined. And yet it never seems false. It rings with honesty and insight. Within the context of an award for innovation, the jury notes that the winning entry comes from a podcast called The Heart. The independence of the podcast has opened doors for a new freedom of expression, leading to adventures in style, content, tone, and collaboration. The winning entry was created by an independent Canadian producer, living in the United States, making stories on a digital platform with no borders. It is the essence of the emerging reality of radio production.",

    "reasoning": "In this category we have looked for excellence, excellence which couldn't have been achieved if not through an international coproduction. The E-waste tragedy is an investigative documentary about illegal trafficking of dangerous and polluting electronic waste from Europe and the US towards developing countries. The history starts with Mike Anane a Ghanean journalist wanting to find out how an old PC owned by the Westminster College in the UK could end up in a dumping site in Accra. Thanks to a large support from a great number of international broadcasters as well as national and local institutions, filmmaker Cosima Dannoritzer has been able to investigate around the world and provide a mind-blowing film on an issue that concerns us all. We have reached an unanimous consensus in believing that this film has the power to raise awareness on the impact that our choices as consumers of electronic goods have on the environment and the social conditions in some developing countries as well as discover the international criminal network operating this illegal trade. We appreciated the strength and the accuracy of the investigation, the courage of the filmmaker and her main characters, for their positive approach on highlighting how each one of us can make a difference to stop this shame. We believe that this is public service at its best and we encourage members of the Prix Italia to join forces on more coproductions of this type.",

One, the biological mother, a Turkish immigrant to Austria; the other a woman who chose to become a mother of an SOS children's village after an international career. It captures the challenges faced by each of the women: firstly, Keziban, and her determination in bringing up five children as an immigrant in a new culture, against all odds and with a background of abject poverty and domestic violence; and with the tragic ending of suicide. Secondly, Angela, approaching motherhood for the first time, enables Keziban's five children to rise above their situation, recreating a healthy family environment, and giving them independence and identity. In return, she discovers a deep fulfillment, through the challenge, closeness and affection which is a reward of motherhood. The production allows this engaging story to tell itself simply and effectively, principally through the mouths of the children, without special effects or embellishments. The use of the microphone brings us close to their feelings and emotions, reflecting very high quality direction and editing. This radio feature skillfully sums up the courage and the strengths of the two women and explores a variety of issues which meet the criteria of the Prize. It combines the eternal story of motherhood with key contemporary issues including immigration, identity, and family values.",

In a compelling way, the film mirrors the thoughts and aspirations of Naoki who teaches us that the abilities and capacities of people with autism should be understood and appreciated. Part of the strength of the film lies in the use of delicate and oblique camera shots that respect the sense of self of the main protagonists. Overall, the film presents a rounded approach to autism and how people should respond to it.",

We chose to celebrate a work dealing with one of the most dramatic issues in our history: one of people compelled by war, violence and loss of their basic human rights to leave their own country. The third of anniversary of 3rd October 2013 migrant shipwreck disaster off Lampedusa falls this week and it is precisely here on this same island, the symbol of solidarity and welcome, where we are, the Special Prize of the President of the Italian Republic to EXODUS: Breaking into Europe, directed by James Bluemel, co-produced by the BBC based on an idea from KEO Films. This work innovatively, movingly and devoid of rhetoric records the terrible consequences of the war in Syria and the journey undertaken by thousands for Europe. Everything may be summed up in the frank words uttered by one of the protagonists when his feet first touch European soil: \"This is Europe? I thought it'd be\".",

The phone or i-pad becomes a vital instrument to keep humans human. It connects and helps to see the refugees as human beings as the ones who will watch the documentary.

The story starts with the terrorist attack in Paris in 2015. This is the exposition for two narratives lines – wider one geopolitical relation between France and Algeria back in the early 1960's and more intimate line about the narrator who tries to figure out the historical episode of his grandfather who was working for the government as a police officer. The original title \"De guerre en fils\" emphasizes that the influence of the past continues. The jury was impressed by the high quality of the overall production: the narration, the dramaturgy with many layers, the sound design, the translation of the story into the radiophonic language and the rhythm which captivates the listener from the beginning to the very end. The production is very up to date, suitable also for a younger audience and the final quality is that it works for both web and broadcast.",

Despite none of us knowing the author, we were all captivated by the way the film used multilayered storytelling – blending animation with re-enactment with interview to weave the everyday life of this writer with his bizarre and yet universal stories. The use of animation was well-placed  and linked the surreal with the anecdotal and was the perfect way to bring the written word to life. It brought out the performance of his work and enhanced the gentle and relaxed pacing and rhythm of the film. The film contained charm and wit and had a real affection for the characters and was surprising from the first scene to the last.",

The winner is the Dutch documentary Alicia – made by the excellent one woman-team Maasja Ooms, co-produced by VPRO Television. The film Alicia is not only a powerful portrait of a young girl drifting from foster family care to life in institutions. It's also a portrait of a system that is not working, social heritage and lack of love. A sensitive subject treated with warm compassion without judging the absent mother or the social workers. The documentary shows excellence in all aspects of filmmaking: best directing, best camera work, best storytelling and best editing. It's beautifully put together with emotional breaks to help the audience breath, and reflect. It punches us in the stomach with a message we never will forget. The prize doesn't only go to the filmmaker – we also want to dedicate it to Alicia herself for sharing her life with us. Thank you!",

    "reasoning": "Initially conceived as a TV- only program dealing with the social emergency of adolescent suicides in Japan at the beginning of the school year, \"TV for the Sake of Living\" has been able to reinvent itself brilliantly to more efficiently meet the needs of its teenagers target audience, that mainly uses the digital platforms. The series has been able to reinterpret the role of the Japanese public service, developing a very delicate topic and offering spaces of comfort, advice and interaction for its younger audiences on TV and Digital, without distinction between the linear and the non-linear Experience. The TV program, in which digital and technology have been brilliantly integrated as a model for today's future public service, has become a perfect marketing and communication vehicle for the online support services, reversing all traditional hierarchies between linear and non-linear and deeply innovating thanks to the strength of its contents and its mission. Digital platforms gave each young individual the opportunity for direct therapy and catharsis. And although the community was on a public platform, it did create a sense of intimate relationship.",

We believe that with its digital and technological innovation, at the service of News, the product very highly matches the criteria of the Prix Italia Web category.

    "reasoning": "A Sea of Shame recounts a tragic story, already familiar to its Italian audience, from a fresh perspective. Through excellent storytelling, the loss of hundreds of lives at sea is kept intimate by focusing on just three immigrant fathers and their families. Events gradually unfold in a way that maintains suspense, layered with appropriate emotion-laden imagery that reaches us at a deep affective level.  The effect challenges the severe moral failure of individuals and nations to rescue a floundering vessel.",

Giving identity and dignity to the dead is not only a moral but also a civil duty. This is the activity carried out by Labanof, the forensic anthropology and odontology laboratory of the University of Milan. Over the course of the story, the initial cold impact of the reality of a lifeless body is replaced by the growing warmth that springs from the compassion and humanity which imbues the entire documentary. Because, as Professor Cristina Cattaneo, founder and director of the laboratory, says: \"Identifying the dead helps to heal the living\".",

Thanks to the courage of people involved in this production, viewers learn about the true face of a repressive China regime too often disguised beneath kind and compliant smiles. This well-crafted documentary, shot mostly by hidden cameras, not only explores the repressive conditions faced by the Uyghur minority, but also examines the major privacy issues related to the use and spread of advanced technology in the name of state security.  Beyond the blatantly violent use of it against Uyghur people in China, can we presume to be safe and free in our western democracies where the same technologies are becoming more and more invasive?  This is a crucial question to keep carefully in mind if we are to preserve and defend human dignity and human rights in our present and upcoming future.",

The artist skillfully demonstrates shifts between seemingly opposite narration styles; from the documentary to the sport allegorical – from cutting edges of cold facts to heart beats and disembodied reality of the hospital. \"You'll be a Man, Dad\" is a touching masterpiece. It offers an unusual dynamic radiophonic richness that in a light, yet captivating way, draws our attention and invites us into the fields where wounded hearts heal.",

The Jury described it as an almost cinematic personal journey that provides a strong narrative for a complex, layered debate. We especially appreciated the relationship between the author and the main protagonist. \"The Skull\" shows how a radio production of a country can have a strong social impact, globally, by grounding itself on our common pursuit – human rights.",

It grappled with difficult topics in a slow, sensuous programme which gave time for the listener to reflect and wrestle with tricky ideas.

    "reasoning": "It's a Sin is a poignant period drama series that chronicles the journey of four friends from diverse backgrounds in the 1980s, as they experience first-hand the devastating effects of the spread of the AIDS pandemic within the gay community. Peppered with a lot of humor, the show skillfully holds the hand of the viewer and seamlessly takes them from one emotion to another. The story manages to be both profoundly tragic and immersively fun at the same time. The representation of the roles and the skills of such complex characters keep the viewer in the grip, whilst delivering the story's important message directly to the heart. More than just the theme of sexuality, this drama series also touches on other relevant themes such as parenting, freedom of expression, stigma, discrimination, prejudice and the marginalization of queer communities by the broader society; themes that ring true to this day. \"It's a Sin\" is a moving period drama, modern and fresh. It is a minority story that touches the majority.",

All bearing deep psychological scars and living in constant fear at first, we witness their slow but remarkable transformation as they regain their trust in humanity. Each of them starts seeing a flicker of light as they slowly come to terms with their dark past, armed with a renewed sense of hope for their future. The story of the Holocaust has been retold many times in different forms but the uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that it is not about the Holocaust, but rather because of the Holocaust. Watching this story about them winning back their normal life, it reminds us of how important and precious human rights are.",

The Jury agrees that the producers delivered a well-crafted and easily accessible interactive experience that combines the popular lockdown habits of fishing and bingo and accommodates the growing hunger of the public for real emotions and shared experiences. Beneath its playful facade, \"Fish Bingo\" is a prime example of how digital media can be used in the service of vital socio-emotional skills such as empathy and how it can remedy the negative effects of prolonged isolation.",

We believe that \"Little Girl\" is the best made programme, most innovative, exposing an appealing and catching story while covering a risky and original topic. It draws attention to a very important subject and complex topic which is presented in an artistic, emotional and elegant way, helping in raising social awareness on this subject through the story of Sasha. The \"Little girl\" is an extremely strong protagonist that turned her struggles into strength while facing a cruel world. Moreover the relation, the bond between the courageous mother and her daughter create a moving documentary and bring the story closer to the viewer.",

    "reasoning": "We applaud this documentary for raising the issue of a \"David & Goliath\" situation in which wealthy Hedge Funds and other investors trade housing as assets, in much the same way as they would trade a commodity such as gold, without regard to the displacement of tenants, many of whom are poorer people, immigrants, the elderly and refugees. Swedish Television has excelled in showing us that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provision that adequate housing is the right of every child, woman and man, everywhere, flagrantly ignored by unbridled capitalism, a position that numerous countries legally endorse in spite of its intrinsically amoral nature. The filmmakers are to be commended for raising in such a powerful manner an issue of universal concern.",

It uses subtle, realistic sounds to create a compressed and claustrophobic soundscape which – convincingly, terrifyingly – takes the listener along on Emma's journey. Horror is a tricky genre, and loneliness is a tricky subject for audio fiction. \"803\" makes it look easy, transfixing the listener. It treads a delicate line – deftly – between the supernatural and the psychological, and speaks powerfully of a generation which has experienced more isolation than most. An outstanding script and intelligent direction draw sympathetic, authentic performances from an excellent cast. \"803\" is perfectly paced to allow space for sound, to create a truly radiophonic story.",

Viewers are invited to take a reflective and existential walk from dawn to dusk, through the amazing performance of classical music created centuries ago and performed by The Orchestre de Paris and now shown and performed with an elegant and modern 21st-century look. The show has a clear structure which is wrapped in beautiful music and harmonies that connect us to our past, present and future and remind us of the four elements of life. Shot in several aesthetically beautiful and carefully selected locations, \"Quinte & Sens\" is a powerful expression of the emotions, the isolation and the feelings that people experienced during the lockdown. The performances manage to invoke all the senses making us to think about our essence as human beings and the relationship that we have with ourselves, each other, nature and our planet; connecting us to this year's Prix Italia theme of Sustainability. \"Quinte & Sens\" displayed superior production values and it managed to innovate and found a new method to aesthetically visualise and realise the attraction and beauty in the musical pieces that were performed. There was great care in the design and framing of the shots that demonstrated a total regard and respect for the composers and the musicians. The director and DOP on this production displayed a rare and unexpected capacity to make the camera to be a tool through which the viewer can truly sense the music. The beauty of this show lies in its authenticity, sincerity and purity and succeeds in giving us a different point of view in a world that is filled with much confusion and contradictions. The show invites us to bring to the world the best part of ourselves. The jury was unanimous in selecting \"Quinte & Sens\" as the outright winner.",

The same courage is asked of the viewer to immerse themselves into the personal life of a formidable artist, photographer and storyteller who did not allow her disease to define who she was. The story is told in such a way that it is very difficult to separate Lene Marie's personal life from her art. The story structure and visualisation are raw, uncensored, brutally honest and in your face; making it very difficult to watch at times. We see Lene struggle with her disease (Anorexia) and we feel her pain and at times joy through her powerful and moving images that tell a thousand words. This brave piece can be seen as a searchlight of a young woman and an artist who discovers herself and finds recognition in the world and for the first time can see herself beyond her illness. The message of this documentary is strong, impactful and profound. Audiences are left shaken to the core and are pushed to the extreme with their emotions taken through a test. The jury appreciated this documentary not only for the way it was made but also for its social impact which is the reason why it deserves a special mention.",

A drama of raw and unpolished energy that literally smacks you in the face and shakes your whole existence. The storytelling is uncompromising and breaks all the molds, flooding the viewer with a particularly intense emotional display that keeps you glued to your seat. The viewer is never indifferent nor distant: the film constantly moves you from tenderness and compassion to pain, fear, and outrage. The jury would like to dedicate the prize, in particular to the young actress Helena Zenegel. The jury is impressed by her performance as the 9-year-old girl Benny whom no one will ever be able to forget.",

The crowd lost again and again but in the end – with a little help – their collective wisdom managed to beat the champion. An astonishing piece of work that served a specific and dedicated audience in an educational yet entertaining manner. \"The Grand Master vs Sweden\" expands the boundaries of what is possible with slow tv interactivity in a long, yet captivating production.",

Often neglected and marginalized, the film shows how instead indigenous communities can represent a treasure with their wealth of ancestral knowledge and their symbiosis with the natural environment. It offers a different view on indigenous people, one that is far removed from that of the stereotypical primitive person, showing us a community that embraces modernity, technology, gender equality democratic processes to move forward and address future development, while retaining their identity and a sustainable relationship with the environment and its resources. We highly appreciated the strength of the protagonists, especially the female leaders, showing us a different form of self-determination and women empowerment as a powerful way to social and environmental sustainability. The film never has a didactic approach but rather is looking for the authentic voices when representing this specific community.",

Great fluency of the narration in a two-hour masterpiece, full of love, passions and emotion. Chaplin is an anti-war and a peace promoter but, at the same time, he challenges some main social and political issues of his time through his artistic sensitiveness. Despite he came from a broken and poor family, he never lost his hope and dreams, thus becoming a role model for many, especially for young people. This is why this work is both educational and entertaining, just like many of Chaplin's works of art, which make us think deeper besides laughter. By this big award, the Jury wishes to pay tribute to such a popular man and actor, in particular in a time of planetary troubles, with a message of hope, beauty and peace.",

Producer and presenter James Vyver has achieved one of the most difficult things on radio, taking a niche historical subject – the rise and fall of two tech entrepreneurs – and making it relevant to modern life, and accessible for the broadest possible listenership. He achieves this through a crystal clear narrative and easy tone of voice, making this modern tech adventure engaging from the start. The programme demonstrates a high quality of production, with an admirable attention to detail in the editing and sound design, and the use of innovative techniques such as AI voice generation. The duration is perfect in today’s busy world of never-ending podcasts. The fact that this programme is the result of a small operation – James himself undertaking the majority of the production work, alongside sound engineer John Jacobs – deserves credit and is a good example of how the best stories in audio can be told with limited resources.",

    "reasoning": "Author Laura Uribe deepens our understanding for a traumatic loss, individual and collective, using the radio medium in an artistic and personal way that exceeds the pure facts and makes Campo a real work of art. This is a story about unheard voices of mothers, sisters and wives looking for a truth about their beloved ones kidnapped and murdered by Mexican cartels. However, the artistic and poetic form of this docu-fiction piece deepens our understanding beyond the pure presentation of facts. The author herself is deeply involved with the story and faces an existential question during her work: shall she join the side of action or just continue to be a witness? Shall she dig or shall she write? With Campo she gives the answer: the act of writing that unburies the bodies of loved ones is also an act of fighting against the destructive, annihilating power of a criminal system. And in this intense audio production for German radio, the successful transferal and reenactment of a Mexican reality in a different language, by actors unfamiliar with this painful reality, unveils the universal core of this drama. The stories of the missing sons and daughters, fathers and brothers do matter - to Mexico and to the world. And even more matters the strength and love of the women telling their stories.",

The storytelling is full of small treasures showing other layers of the film; music and the absence of music, the sounds of dance in perfect combination with the music of John Cage and Eric Satie; a poetic fusion of old and new choreography, old and new archival material; the innovative use of graphics, never repeating the same pattern on the one hand and not overdoing with the novelty one the other; the storytelling giving the viewer only hints about certain phases and relationships in Merce Cunningham's life. The film is a true reminder of Cunningham work and his influence in contemporary dance, for us and for future generations alike - a dancing poetry, a poetry of dance.",

    "reasoning": "Cómo el machismo marcó nuestra adolescencia (How Sexism Shaped Our Teenage Years), crowned as the victor of the Digital Interactive Category at the 75th Prix Italia in Bari, stands out as a testament to the profound capabilities of interactive media in the modern age. A brainchild of the RTVE Lab, it both illuminates and critiques the multifaceted dimensions of interactive digital creations. Indeed, the jurors had prolonged discussions on the nuanced understanding of interactivity, highlighting the intricate relationship between the user, content, editors and archives. This work isn't just merely a dialogue between the user and content but it is a multilayered interaction where users engage with historical media, editors weave through a vast archive to curate a unique experience, and the past is juxtaposed against contemporary issues in a powerful confrontation. Beyond its primary focus, the project also demonstrates a sustainable and reflective approach to using archives, prompting us, as media practitioners, to consider the vast and rapidly evolving nature of media production and to reflect on our role and the long-term impact of the stories that we tell as well as the images that we create and broadcast. By allowing participants of different generations to navigate the media environment of adolescent life over past decades, the project holds up a mirror to society and unravels longstanding gender biases embedded within the Spanish media landscape. Its potent spotlight on sexism, serves as a call to action, emphasising the profound social impact such projects can have. As we acknowledge its significance in challenging gender biases, we are optimistic about its blueprint being used to address a plethora of other social issues in the future. The decision to present media in its untouched form not only accentuates authenticity but also amplifies the conversation about the significant role and responsibility broadcasters have in shaping societal narratives and perceptions. How Sexism Shaped Our Teenage Years is an excellent example of public service media. It is a beacon of hope, underscoring the transformative power of media and its potential for social change.",
